# Monalect

## Introduction

Monalect is a personal course manager, and a self-learning management system. It allows users to upload their learning material, and go through it.

At first, users are expected to create their own questions to test themselves gainst the material, but shareable courses are planned.

Monalect is a web-app built with [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/). I highly recommend it as a pure Javascript full-stack framework. It's simplified, yet complicated enough for the user to use.

Monalect will eventually be wholly hosted on https://www.monalect.com 

It should be done by the end of August 2022, that's my last deadline.

## To-Do

I'm quite a ways into programming it without a to-do list. I'm content this way. Not knowing how much left I have to do immensely helps with motivation productivity, because I just focus on the next immediate thing.

When the first version comes out, I'll start taking the features more seriously.

### Polishing 

+ [ ] Add CSS transitions for smoother UI
+ [ ] Make personally designed dropdown menu, instead of the browser provided one.
+ [ ] Ensure important delete actions have confirmation prompts.
+ [ ] Frontend Validation for more soft things like textbook ISBN and what not

### Future Priority Features

+ [ ] Drag & Drop functionality 
+ [ ] Import & Export functionality
+ [ ] Faster, more lightweight PDF viewer (*I have second thoughts on this one, but we'll see if pdf.js express works out*)
+ [ ] Frontend Data Caching

## Thank Yous

This section is a just a reminder to thank the people that helped me when I'm done with this thing.
